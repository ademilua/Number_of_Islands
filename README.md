# Number_of_Islands
This code is writing with Ada and Spark. Spark was used to prove the correctness of the program.

Description:
You are given a map of an area. The map is a NxM grid of tiles. A tile can either be a water tile (0) or a land tile (1).
Your task will be to count the number of islands on that map. An island is considered to be a connected set of land tiles.
Land tiles can only be connected either vertically or horizontally.
Input:
A text file that on the first line contains two integers N M. This line is followed by N lines filled that have M characters (0, 1) each.
4 5
10110
00010
00101
01001
Output:
Your program should return a single integer containing number of islands on the map (e.g 5 in the example above).
